sre is an [eve](https://eve.dev) incident response agent for Slack. It brings together the observability data you need to debug an alert or incident across Datadog, GitHub, Vercel, and other tools. Investigations are read-only by default.

Mention `@sre`, watch a channel for alerts, or invoke it from an external system with a webhook. The agent checks hypotheses against live signals and records each finding with a source link. Replies start with the answer, then the supporting evidence.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)][deploy-with-vercel]

## How it works

An investigation starts from one of three places.

- A Slack mention or direct message.
- A new top-level message in a watched Slack channel.
- A `POST /v1/investigate` webhook call.

The agent records novel, decision-relevant findings with source links. Each investigation turn has its own evidence set. The agent records each finding-and-URL pair once, then adds recorded evidence to the Slack result.

Automated runs use webhook metadata and service-authenticated tools. They do not use per-user OAuth.

Channel watch and custom skills are optional. Both store state in Vercel Blob. The Blob store is required only for these two features.

## Set up the project

Select [**Deploy with Vercel**][deploy-with-vercel] to clone the repository, create a Vercel project, and provision the connectors and storage.

| Provisioned                                       | Sets                                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Slack connector with trigger path `/eve/v1/slack` | `SLACK_CONNECTOR`                   |
| GitHub connector, read-only install               | `GITHUB_CONNECTOR`                  |
| Datadog connector                                 | `DATADOG_CONNECTOR`                 |
| Vercel MCP connector                              | `SRE_VERCEL_CONNECTOR`              |
| Private Vercel Blob store                         | Vercel Blob environment variables   |

For a complete CLI setup with your agent, use [`docs/setup-for-agents.md`](./docs/setup-for-agents.md).

After deployment:

1. Invite the Slack app to a channel.
2. Mention `@sre` and confirm that the app replies.
3. To enable automated runs via a webhook, follow [`docs/automate-investigations.md`](./docs/automate-investigations.md).

## Local development

```bash
pnpm install
vercel link
vercel env pull
pnpm dev
```

## Environment configuration

| Variable            | Required          | Default         | What it does                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SLACK_CONNECTOR`   | No                | `slack/sre`     | Connector UID for the Slack channel and bot Web API.                                                    |
| `GITHUB_CONNECTOR`  | No                | `github/sre`    | Connector UID for the GitHub tools extension.                                                           |
| `DATADOG_CONNECTOR` | No                | `datadog/sre`   | Connector UID for the Datadog MCP tools.                                                                |
| `SRE_VERCEL_CONNECTOR` | No             | `vercel/sre`     | Connector UID for the Vercel MCP tools.                                                                |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET`    | No | none            | Shared secret for `POST /v1/investigate`. Use a long random value from Node crypto (`randomBytes(32)`). |
| `DD_SITE`           | No                | `datadoghq.com` | Datadog site for MCP. Examples are `datadoghq.eu` and `us5.datadoghq.com`.                              |

Copy [`.env.example`](./.env.example) to `.env` to set local environment variables.

## Automation endpoint

`POST /v1/investigate` accepts a title, a Slack channel, an optional description, and optional metadata. It returns `202` and starts a Slack investigation.

The endpoint uses `WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Send the secret with `x-sre-webhook-secret` or `Authorization: Bearer`.

## Customize the agent

- Edit `agent/instructions/instructions.md` to change general behavior.
- Edit the built-in skills in `agent/skills/` to change investigation and handoff procedures.
- Add tools or connections for other operational systems using Vercel Connect.
- Integrate with `agent/channels/webhook.ts` to invoke the agent from any external system (see [`docs/automate-investigations.md`](./docs/automate-investigations.md)).

### Create runbooks in Slack

Ask `@sre` to create a runbook for a recurring alert or incident. Global runbooks apply to every session. Personal runbooks apply only to the requesting Slack user and override global runbooks with the same name. The agent loads a saved runbook on a later matching request, not during the request that creates it. Private Vercel Blob storage is required to save and load runbooks.

## Verify changes

```bash
pnpm validate
pnpm test
```

## Troubleshooting

- If Slack mentions do not arrive, confirm that the trigger path is `/eve/v1/slack`.
- If a webhook returns `401`, confirm that the caller and the deployment use the same `WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- If an investigation does not start, confirm that the bot is a member of `slackChannel`.
- If custom skills fail to save, confirm that the private Blob store is connected.
- If Vercel tools request authorization, complete the Vercel Connect sign-in for the Slack user. Automated runs do not have a user identity, so they cannot use this connection.
